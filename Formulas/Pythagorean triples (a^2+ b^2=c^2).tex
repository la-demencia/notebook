\begin{itemize}
\item Given an arbitrary pair of integers $m$ and $n$ with $m > n > 0$:\\
$a = m^2 - n^2$, $b = 2mn$, $c = m^2 + n^2$
\item The triple generated by Euclid's formula is primitive if and only if $m$ and $n$ are coprime and not both odd.
\item To generate all Pythagorean triples uniquely:\\
$a = k (m^2 - n^2)$, $b = k(2mn)$, $c = k(m^2 + n^2)$
\item If $m$ and $n$ are two odd integer such that $m > n$, then:\\
$a = mn$, $b = \frac{m^2 - n^2}{2}$, $c = \frac{m^2 + n^2}{2}$
\item If $n=1$ or $2$ there are no solutions. Otherwise\\
$n$ is even: ($(\frac{n^2}{4} - 1)^2 + n^2 = (\frac{n^2}{4} + 1)^2$)\\
$n$ is odd: ($(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2})^2 + n^2 = (\frac{n^2 + 1}{2})^2$)
\end{itemize}
